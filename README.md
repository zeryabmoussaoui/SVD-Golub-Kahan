# SVD-Golub-Kahan
Singular Value computation using Golub-Kahan method, an efficient and real-time method. 

## What is this ?

A m-file which implements the Golub-Kahan method for SVD computation, i did it when i was an undergraduate student and find it now useful to share.

## What is required ?

It's compatible with all m-file interpreter (Matlab, GNU Octave, Scilab).
However, GNU Octave is recommended. It's free, open-source and native in many Linux distibutions.

To use it, just download [svd2.m](./svd2.m) file and execute it on your m-file interpreter.

## How does it work ?

The method is described in the following article : [GOLUB-KAHAN-1965](./GOLUB-KAHAN-1965.pdf)

A (very old) temporary report can be found here : [Report](./report.odt) but has not been yet translated from French.
